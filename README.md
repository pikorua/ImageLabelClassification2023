This project is for the 'Introduction to Deep Learning Course', this project was done by Paul Sarninghausen-Cahn and Simon Maedge. The group name is 'Simon says.' You can download the source code from the 'master' branch.


# When downloaded Code, do the following to let it run:
  1. Load training images to a folder named 'images'.
  2. Load test images to a folder named 'images' in the folder 'imagesTest'
  3. run the python file: createPT.py in the src folder
  4. run the python file: main.py in the src folder; in that file the training takes place. The last model will be saved in 'resnetMultiLabel.pt'.
  5. The last trained model can be tested by running the test.py in the main folder.
